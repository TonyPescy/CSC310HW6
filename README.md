# CSC310HW6
 For this assignment, write a program, in two different languages (the first language should be one of C/C++/C#/Java and the second language should be any other than C/C++/C#/Java), to produce outputs for the following:  Assume that there are two arbitrary size of real arrays (Max. size 30), the main program reads in real numbers into two real arrays, and echo print your input, call a subroutine Bubble sort for the first array to be sorted, and then print out the first sorted array in the main. Call a subroutine Selection sort for the second array to be sorted, and then print out the second sorted array in the main. Call a subroutine MERGE that will merge together the contents of the two sorted (ascending order) first array and second array, storing the result in the third (brand new array) real array. Print out the contents of third array in main. Finally, call a function Binary Search with a target in the merged array (third) and return the array index of the target to the main, and print out the array index.
